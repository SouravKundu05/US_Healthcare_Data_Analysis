## Project Overview

This project analyzes a hospital patient dataset to identify disease patterns, cost drivers, and hospital workload trends using Microsoft Excel.
The objective was to transform raw healthcare data into actionable insights for patient cost reduction and hospital resource optimization.

## Dataset Features

The dataset contains patient-level hospital records including:

* Demographics (Age, Gender, Age Group)
* Medical Condition & Medication
* Admission Type & Length of Stay (LOS)
* Billing Amount & Insurance Provider
* Admission and Discharge Dates

## Tools Used

* Microsoft Excel
* Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
* Data Cleaning & Formatting
* Time-Series Analysis

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Demographic Disease Analysis

Grouped patients into Adult, Senior, and Old categories to identify most common medical conditions.
**Insight:** Chronic diseases were more prevalent among older patients.

### 2. Cost Analysis

Calculated average billing across admission types and insurance providers.
**Insight:** Emergency admissions showed the highest average cost compared to elective admissions.

### 3. Resource Utilization Analysis

Performed monthly admission trend analysis and evaluated length of stay.
**Insight:** Emergency admissions caused workload spikes and longer hospital occupancy.

## Key Business Recommendations

* Encourage preventive healthcare to avoid emergency hospitalization
* Schedule elective treatments during low workload periods
* Improve discharge planning to reduce bed occupancy
* Select cost-effective insurance coverage
